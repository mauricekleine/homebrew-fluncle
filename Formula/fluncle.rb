# Homebrew formula for the Fluncle CLI.
#
# Pulls the prebuilt Bun --compile binaries published to GitHub Releases by the
# `CLI Release` workflow (apps/cli assets `fluncle-<os>-<arch>`). No build step:
# each platform downloads its standalone binary and installs it as `fluncle`.
#
# This file lives in the mauricekleine/fluncle monorepo as the canonical source.
# It is copied into the tap repo `mauricekleine/homebrew-fluncle` as
# `Formula/fluncle.rb`. See README.md in this directory for seeding + bumping.
#
# To refresh for a new release vX.Y.Z, set `version` and replace each `sha256`
# with the checksum of the matching release asset (see README for a one-liner,
# or use `brew bump-formula-pr`).
class Fluncle < Formula
  # A colon, not an em dash: `brew info fluncle` prints this to a stranger, and VOICE.md §6
  # sanctions exactly one em dash (the `Artist — Title` tracklist separator).
